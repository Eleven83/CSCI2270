# CSCI2270
This repository contains various topics and examples of my work in Data Structures at CU Boulder.

COURSE TOPICS
Studies data abstractions (e.g., stacks, queues, lists, trees) and their representation techniques (e.g.,
linking, arrays). Introduces concepts used in algorithm design and analysis including criteria for selecting
data structures to fit their applications.

In this course, students will:
* Document code including precondition/postcondition contracts for functions and invariants for classes.
* Create and recognize appropriate test data for simple problems, including testing boundary conditions and creating/running test cases.
* Design and test new classes using the principle of information hiding for the following data structures: array-based collections (including dynamic arrays), list-based collections (singly-linked lists, doubly-linked lists, circular-linked lists), stacks, queues, binary search trees, hash tables, graphs, and at least one balanced search tree.
* Identify the features and applications of common data structures, including records/structs, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and maps.
* Implement algorithms for standard operations on common data structures and discuss the complexity of the operations.
* Comment on the features of different traversal methods for trees and graphs, including pre-, post-, and in-order traversal of trees.
* Describe the implementation of hash tables, including algorithms for collision avoidance and resolution.
* Describe the principles of recursion and iteration, and implement recursive and iterative solutions for a problem.
* Formulate and implement solutions to problems using fundamental graph algorithms, including depth-first and breadth-first search and a shortest-path algorithm.
* Explain the features of at least one tree balancing algorithm and how tree balancing affects the efficiency of various binary search tree operations.
* Correctly use and manipulate pointer variables to change variables and build dynamic data structures.
* Explain the differences between dynamic and static data structure implementations, and justify the use of static and dynamic implementations in different applications.
* Practice explaining design choices and algorithm features in small-group settings.

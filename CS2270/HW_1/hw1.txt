CSCI 2270 - Data Structures
Professor: Shayon Gupta, Fall 2018
TA: Saumya Sinha
Author: Ryan A. Hoffman

The purpose of this assignment is to review some fundamentals of C++ programming 
to better assess my understanding and identify some strengths and weaknesses in my knowledge. 

The objectives include:
	1. Read-in command line arguments
	2. Read a file
	3. Loop through an array
	4. Split a string
	5. Create an array of structs
	6. Pass by reference
	7. Create a class with constructors
	8. Create header files with header guards

The assignment is broken down into three different problems. 
Each problem requires implementation of some combination of the above listed objectives.

These are to be submitted for grading through Moodle.

Problem 1:
This requires the creation of a function called insertIntoSortedArray().
The declaration is given to us as: 
	int insertIntoSortedArray(int myArray[], int numEntries, int newValue);
The specifics are in the write-up, however, the main idea here is that I need to read in a 
file name from the command line and the file is just a list of integers each on their own line. 
	Like this:
		59
		17
		24
		99
		.
		.
		.
Each line is a number therefore each line gets stored in an int array of size 100.  
Now, the function, insertIntoSortedArray(), will get passed our sorted array of ints, 
the actual number of filled entries in that array, and a new value to be added.

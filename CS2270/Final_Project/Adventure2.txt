Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a 2004 American comedy film directed by Adam McKay, 
produced by Judd Apatow, starring Will Ferrell, and written by McKay and Ferrell. 
The film is a tongue-in-cheek take on the culture of the 1970s, particularly the new Action News format.
It portrays a San Diego TV station where Ferrell's title character clashes with his new female counterpart.
